# Algorithms using C#, .NET 7.0 Isolated Azure Functions

A repository with a collection of data structures, algorithms and some leetcode questions done using Azure Functions to make running problems easier. 

Each problem is encapsulated as a function with HTTP trigger, with an openAPI page. These functions can then be run from within that interface showcasing both openAPI integration along with Algorithms, Data Structures, Graph Algorithms and some leetcode problems re-inforcing Computer Science fundamentals. 

PS: There will be more repositories in some of my favorite languages including Python, Go, Rust, Java, C and Typescript (Sorry Javascript fans)
